length = 20
width = 10

print(length + width)

# i think i did tis wrong so here is the version i think is right(press ctrl and this "/" to make it work while the code is selected)

# length = 20
# width = 10
# num = 2

# full_length = length * num
# full_width = width * num

# print(full_length + full_width)
